ðŸŒ€ The Flying Disc Hub
A dynamic website dedicated to disc golf enthusiasts!

ðŸ“– Project Overview
The Flying Disc Hub is an interactive, multi-page website designed for disc golf players of all skill levels. The site provides essential information on local courses, upcoming events, disc golf tips, and web security. Additionally, it includes interactive forms that allow users to calculate throw distances, register for events, and provide feedback on their interests.

This project was developed as part of my CIS242 - Web II JavaScript jQuery class.
